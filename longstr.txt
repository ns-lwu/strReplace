“Heavens! what a virulent attack!” replied the prince, not in theleast dis
concerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing anembroidered c
ourt uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars onhis breast and a serene expre
ssion on his flat face. He spoke in thatrefined French in which our grandfathers not only 
spoke but thought, andwith the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importancewho had 
grown old in society and at court. He went up to Anna Pávlovna,kissed her hand, presenting
 to her his bald, scented, and shining head,and complacently seated himself on the sofa.
